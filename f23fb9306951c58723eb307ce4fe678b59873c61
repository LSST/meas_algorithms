Michael Wood-Vasey (correctly) comments:

A small quibble with the description of the change:
the change applies to func, which is either numpy.median and numpy.mean
depending on the useMedian keyword. The default is numpy.mean. Even if
useMedian is selected, numpy.median falls back on taking the mean of the
middle two elements of an array if N is even.

I might suggest generalizing the description to include both median and mean
to clarify that it applies to either option in _kclusters.
