         * LocalShapeletKernel is appropriate for a small patch of an image 
         * where the variation is expected to be minimal (e.g. over the size 
         * of a galaxy).
         *
         * It uses a shapelet description of the PSF for its underlying
         * implementation.  As such, the functional form is an analytic
         * function f(x,y) = Sum_pq b_pq psi_pq(x,y,sigma).
         * (See the Shapelet class for more details.)
         *
         * The method computeImage is the best way to use this class.
         *
         * The Kernel classes allows for individual pixels to be 
         * calculated one at a time, so we are forced to implement
         * this as well, but it is much less efficient than calculating
         * the whole image at once.
         *
         * There is a suggestion that we also include a method to 
         * calculate the Fourier transform directly.  This would likely
         * be more efficient than going through the normal image
         * via an FFT, since shapelets are their own Fourier transforms
         * (modulo factors of i).  
         * One concern about this, which needs to be considered more
         * carefully, is the effect of the telescope distortion (the Wcs).
         * The shapelets are defined in sky coordinates.  However, the 
         * appropriate image is in chip coordinates.  So there is a
         * local distortion that is applied.  This means that the 
         * direct Fourier transform is not quite as simple as I had
         * initially thought.  However, I do suspect that this detail
         * can be correctly calculated analytically and the method 
         * could be written that is significantly more efficient than
         * the FFT.
